I have created this photography website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website consists of three sections: Home, About Me, and a contact form. 
For its design, I followed a process that included planning the structure, carefully selecting colors and fonts to convey my style, and implementing an interactive form to facilitate communication with visitors.
